To test both REINFORCE and DDPG:

run the {code}.py file with the tag simple or double tag and then test.

Exemple:

DDPGDouble.py simple test

will run a test of the DDPG algorithm for the single pendulum.

same with Reinforce.py

TO test FQI:

launch the code view_agent.py


weights for XRT are available on github because they were too heavy for the submission platform (https://github.com/Jepi1202).

Dependancies:
-numpy 
-pytorch 2.0
